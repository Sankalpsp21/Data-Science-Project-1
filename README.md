# Data Science Project 1
 
This was a little project of mine over the summer that aimed to look at the relationship between temperature and COVID-19 infection rates. The results were definitely surprising!

# How it was Supposed to go
This was my first project on Jupyter Notebook using Pandas so I wanted to find some cool and relevant data to analyze. What ended up happening was a long and winding journey searching through various dataset websites for data that showed promise. I ended up settling on Temperature and infection rates because 

- **1.** The data wasn't too hard to find and it was clean and 
- **2.** I'd heard some stuff on the news about COVID doing worse in the heat and I wanted to run the numbers.

# What I hope to do in the Future
I'm planning on learning some data aquisition techniques like Web Crawling so I'm not limited to free, public datasets. I heard about someone using that technique to glean informatino off Twitter and make accurate predictions! But for now, I'm proud of this project and hope you give it a read. All sources are listed in the notebook.
